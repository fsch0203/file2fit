MySecret.exe is small - 150 kB - and quick. It uses the Blowfish algorithm to create base64-encoded text output that can be easily transmitted over the Internet or stored on any computer system. For more information on Blowfish see the web site of its inventor, Bruce Schneier and his references to Products that Use Blowfish.
