# File2fit TotalCommander Tools

File2fit is a small collection of TotalCommander tools to manipulate files. The development of these tools is inspired by [FileBlender](https://sector-seven.com/software/fileblender), a standalone command line wrapper to convert, join and split files and a lot more.

The tools are based on vb-script files that can easily be adjusted or extended. Every tool can be integrated in TotalCommander with an entry in the Button Bar or Start Menu.
